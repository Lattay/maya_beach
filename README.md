# Maya Beach

Time management game for I Can't Draw Game Jam 2020

## Concept

Make as much money as you can from this lil' beach, so that you could even buy the whole island !
Don't freak out ! That's a good ol' tourist magnet that you got here.

## About

Made with Godot, Inkscape and GIMP for the **I Can't Draw but I want to make a Game (again) Game Jam** from May 29th to June 12th.
